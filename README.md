# The Invisible Cart

In November 2021, a team of six students were tasked to create a mobile application using
the Realtime Database from Google's Firebase, Android Studio, Java with an MVP design, and
Github as the file source management system. The Agile Scrum development process was required,
and every two days, sprints were held. User stories mandated restrictions and tailored
this project to store owners and customers. After implementation was completed, the team
tested with JUnit and Mockito to ensure a bug-free environment.
